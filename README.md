Hello, this is to save all of my FCC repos to maintain accountability make sure that I push commits more often while I'm working on FreeCodeCamp. I know most of these exercises are given to me step by step, but this repo is more for my own notes to reference whenever I need a refreshing reference. 

Thanks for reading.
